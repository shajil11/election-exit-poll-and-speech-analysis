## Project Overview

This project is based on two case studies: **Vote Prediction** and **Text Analysis**. Both problems aim to apply machine learning and data analysis techniques to draw meaningful insights from structured and unstructured data.

### Case Study 1: Election Exit Poll Prediction

- **Objective**: Predict which political party a citizen is likely to vote for.
- **Approach**: Classification model based on citizens' age and responses to a structured survey.
- **Dataset Used**: `Election_Data`

### Case Study 2: U.S.A. Presidential Speech Analysis

- **Objective**: Analyze the inaugural speeches of U.S. Presidents to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Approach**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, word frequency analysis, and sentiment analysis.
- **Dataset Used**: `Project_Speech (1)`
